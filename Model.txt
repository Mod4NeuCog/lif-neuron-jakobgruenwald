Timed heat reflex

Subsystems
1. Pain receptors
	measure heat/ damage
	pass pain intensity to CNS
2. CNS
	recieve input from pain receptors 
	check if pain > thresshold
		pass activation signal to motor neuron
3. Motor Neuron (Action)
	monitor input from CNS
	check if activation signal is present
		send contraction signal to muscles



Pain receptor (with inherent “conversion factor”)

start
measure “heat”
convert “heat” to “signal frequency” using “conversion factor”
produce “signal”
pass “signal”
return to start


CNS (with inherent “threshold”, “activation signal”)

start
measure “signal frequency” <- “signal” over period of time 
check if “signal frequency” > “threshold”
	pass “activation signal” to motor neuron
return to start


Motor Neuron

start
monitor input from CNS
check if "activation signal" present
	send "contraction signal" to muscles
return to start
